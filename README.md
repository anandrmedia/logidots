# Core Values

Curiosity - We believe that curiosity is the single biggest factor to achieve success. Keep asking ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow‚Äù. We should never be satisfied. Learn, Validate, Unlearn and Repeat! Even while hiring, we never look for degrees, we look for people with curiosity.


Transparency - Communicating openly is the best way to keep a healthy relationship. Good or bad news, instead of hiding, we believe that talking about it openly solves most of the problems.


Humility - Recognizing and valuing others opinions and feedback is essential no matter how big you are. Nobody knows everything. And nobody is right all the time. We should be willing to accept mistakes, share credit and learn from others.
